<h1>
Mock React Technical Test 
</h1>
<p>
For bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a mock React web application that allows users to search and retrieve images from the NASA image databse through their API.

When a user inputs relevant text such as "moon" or "rocket" into the search area, the relevant images from NASA's image databse will be displayed.
